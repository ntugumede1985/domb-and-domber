# DOMb and DOMber

An exercise in making many kinds of DOM manipulation functions.

(Many of them pretty dumb.)


# Part 1 - Make The Following Functions

**Be sure to pay attention to what each function is supposed to take in and what (if anything) it's supposed to return.**

* A function that takes in a node element and appends it to the `<ul>`.
* A function that takes in a node element and appends it to the `<div>` with the id "lorem".
* A function that takes in text and returns a new `<li>` with that text as its `innerText`.
* A function that takes in an image element and a string and sets that image's source to be that string.
* A function that takes in two elements and sets the second element's class to the same class as the first.
* A function that takes in a tag name and an id, makes an element of that type with that id, and returns it.
* A function that takes in two strings, one representing a color and one representing an id, and sets the thing with that id to have that color for its text.


# Part 2 - Using Those Functions

Now , at the bottom of your code, use ONLY the following tools to do the following tasks.

### Tools

1. The functions you made above.
2. `querySelector`
3. That's it.


### Tasks

* Add three `<li>`s to the `<ul>` with whatever three pieces of text you want.
* Add two images of your choice, with ids of your choice, to the div with the id "lorem".
* Set the second and third `<li>s` in the ordered list to the same class as the first.
* Change the color of the item with the id "heading" to light green.
